            <p>This weather app was created for the SheCodes Plus course final project. The course included learning advanced techniques such as JavaScript arrays, strings, loops, parameters, dates and objects etc. to create a fully funtcional weather app. The app uses SheCodes weather API along with Vanilla JavaScript. Take a few minutes to explore the weather in different cities! </p>

            <p class="text-center">Built using HTML, CSS, and Hosting</p>
            <p>This landing page was created for the SheCodes Basics course final project. I learned basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript variables, if/else statements, functions, selectors and events. This was my first ever coding project and it was exciting to build as it combined my love for baking with my newly acquired skills of coding. </p>
